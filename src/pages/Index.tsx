The main points include: 1) Primary insight, 2) Supporting details, 3) Conclusion. The information suggests that understanding this topic requires considering multiple perspectives and weighing the evidence carefully.`,
      "Question Answering": `Based on my analysis, the answer to "${prompt.slice(0, 30)}..." involves several key considerations. First, we need to understand the context and scope of the question. Then, we can examine the relevant factors: technical aspects, practical implications, and potential outcomes. My recommendation would be to approach this systematically while considering edge cases.`,
      "Code Generation": `Here's my approach to "${prompt.slice(0, 30)}...": \n\n\`\`\`python\ndef solution():\n    # Claude's implementation\n    result = []\n    for item in data:\n        if condition(item):\n            result.append(process(item))\n    return result\n\`\`\`\n\nThis solution prioritizes readability and maintainability. I've included error handling and followed best practices for ${taskType.toLowerCase()}.`,
      "Creative Writing": `"${prompt.slice(0, 20)}..." - what an intriguing premise! Let me craft something special:\n\nThe morning light filtered through ancient windows, casting dancing shadows across the worn wooden floor. Sarah's fingers traced the edge of the mysterious letter, its contents promising to change everything she thought she knew about her family's past. The words seemed to whisper secrets that had been buried for generations, each sentence unraveling a tapestry of hidden truths and forgotten dreams.`,
      "Roleplay": `*adjusts character stance and speaks in character* \n\nAh, regarding "${prompt.slice(0, 30)}..." - as your chosen character, I must say this situation requires careful consideration. *thoughtful pause* In my experience, the best approach would be to first understand all parties involved. Let me share what I've learned from similar circumstances... *continues with authentic character voice and mannerisms*`

Key takeaways: 1) Main concept is well-established, 2) Evidence supports the primary argument, 3) Applications are broad and varied. This topic connects to broader themes in the field and offers valuable insights for practitioners.`,
      "Question Answering": `To address "${prompt.slice(0, 30)}...": The solution involves understanding the fundamental principles and applying them systematically. Key points: methodology, implementation steps, and expected outcomes. I recommend starting with basic concepts before advancing to complex scenarios. This approach ensures solid foundation and reliable results.`,
      "Code Generation": `For "${prompt.slice(0, 30)}...", here's my solution:\n\n\`\`\`python\ndef efficient_solution():\n    # Mistral's optimized approach\n    return [process(x) for x in data if validate(x)]\n\`\`\`\n\nThis implementation focuses on performance and conciseness. The list comprehension provides better memory efficiency, and the validation step ensures data integrity throughout the process.`,
      "Creative Writing": `Inspired by "${prompt.slice(0, 20)}...", here's my take:\n\nThe clock struck midnight as Emma discovered the hidden compartment behind the bookshelf. Inside lay a collection of photographs and letters that revealed a story spanning three generations. Each image told part of a larger narrative - one of love, loss, and the unbreakable bonds that connect us across time. The mystery that had haunted her family was finally beginning to unravel.`,
      "Roleplay": `*enters scene with confidence*\n\nRegarding "${prompt.slice(0, 30)}..." - I believe the situation calls for decisive action. *gestures expressively* From my perspective as this character, we should consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences. The wisdom I've gained suggests that sometimes the boldest move is the right one. *maintains character consistency throughout response*`
